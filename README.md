# PRODIGY_SD_2
A Java-based Guessing Game where players try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides feedback (too high/low) after each guess and tracks the number of attempts, allowing up to 10 guesses. Scores are awarded based on the number of attempts. Developed during my internship at ProDigy Infotech.
